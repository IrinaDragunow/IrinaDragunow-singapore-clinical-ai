## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### RAG System Details
```python
# Vector search implementation
embedding_model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(384)

# Knowledge retrieval
def search_knowledge_base(query, n_results=3):
    query_embedding = embedding_model.encode([query])
    similarities = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, doc_embeddings)
    return ranked_results
```

### Multimodal Processing
```python
# Text + Image fusion
text_entities = medical_nlp.extract_entities(clinical_note)
image_features = image_analyzer.analyze_images(uploaded_images)
combined_analysis = multimodal_fusion(text_entities, image_features)
```

    'primary_term', 'alternative_term', 'abbreviation'
]
```

**Expanding Knowledge Base:**
```python
# In RAGSystem.setup_singapore_knowledge_base()
new_guideline = {
    "id": "educational_specialty_2024",
    "title": "Educational Clinical Simulation - Specialty Management",
    "content": "Simulated guideline content...",
    "hospital": "Educational Demo (Hospital Style)",
    "category": "educational_simulation"
}
```

**Enhancing Image Analysis:**
```python
# In ImageAnalysis.setup_image_types()
self.image_types['new_modality'] = {
    'keywords': ['keyword1', 'keyword2'],
    'findings': ['Educational finding 1', 'Educational finding 2']
}
```

### Performance Optimization
- **Startup Time:** ~30-60 seconds (loading sentence transformers model)
- **Processing Time:** <2 seconds for typical clinical notes
