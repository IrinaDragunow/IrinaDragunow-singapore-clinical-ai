## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### RAG Pipeline
```python
# Semantic search through Singapore medical guidelines
query_embedding = embedding_model.encode(clinical_query)
relevant_guidelines = medical_collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[query_embedding], 
    n_results=3
)
```

### Computer Vision Pipeline
```python
# Analyze medical images with specialized algorithms
if image_type == "Chest X-Ray":
    findings = analyze_chest_xray(medical_image)
elif image_type == "CT Scan":
    findings = analyze_ct_scan(medical_image)
```
